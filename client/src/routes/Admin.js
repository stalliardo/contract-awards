// Questions:
  // How will the targets be set
  // where does the special Projects values come from
  // Same for M&E?
  // Who can set them

  // Special projects and mande will have to be treated as locations to be able to add the values to them
  // might also need to add a flag to the schema to differentiate between actual locations and special / MandE types
