  // Matt C has advised that AWE will be rolled into Avonmouth in the upcoming financail year (24/25).
  // So the AWE location will not be required in the new finacncial year but will still need to be readable when viewing previous years data.

  // Options:
  // 1 - Allow the "generateAllDataForYear" function to still create the location data but manually remove from the databse.
  // 2 - Filter the locations here based on the current year and an array of "noLongerUsedLocations"

  // 3 - Create a year and location matrix that checks the selectedFinacialYear and loads the appropriate locations based off of that.
